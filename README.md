# PHP Slack API Client
This is an API client for [Slack](http://slack.com) for PHP clients, with support for the [Real Time Messaging API](http://api.slack.com/rtm) (RTM API) using web sockets.

## Overview
This library was created primarily for [Slackyboy](https://github.com/coderstephen/slackyboy), but was branched off into its own codebase so it could be used in other projects as well. I created this client because existing clients were either too complicated to use, or buggy, or incomplete. This is also the first PHP client I am aware of to support Slack's RTM API.

This library is licensed under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
